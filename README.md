# HeartDiseasePredictor
 Description:  Develop a Disease Prediction Toolkit by training machine learning models (e.g., logistic  regression, random forest) to predict diseases using real-world health datasets. This  project guides beginners to analyze data, build accurate models, and document results  in a professional portfolio for healthcare AI/ML roles
ü©∫ Disease Prediction Toolkit (AI/ML for Healthcare)
üìå Project Description

This project develops a Disease Prediction Toolkit using Machine Learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.) trained on real-world healthcare datasets such as UCI Heart Disease and Diabetes datasets.

The goal is to help beginners analyze healthcare data, build predictive models, and document results for portfolio creation in AI/ML for healthcare applications.
